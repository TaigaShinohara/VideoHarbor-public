**VideoHarbor** is a privacy-first, open-source browser extension (Chrome & Safari Web Extension) designed for direct video saving and selective recording (specific video element, entire tab, screen, or window).

Zero build steps, zero external runtime dependencies, 100% local processing.

---

## Key Features

- **Direct Video Saving**:
  - Automatically identifies video sources from `<video>`, `<source>`, lazy-load attributes, direct links, Open Graph / Twitter cards, JSON-LD `VideoObject`, and player configurations without executing arbitrary scripts.
  - Choose between original format or remuxed **MP4 (`.mp4`)**.
  - Local MP4 packaging for non-encrypted **HLS** (TS/fMP4 with H.264/AAC without re-encoding) and static **DASH** streams.
  - Direct download support for video blobs.
- **Selective Video & Screen Recording**:
  - **Video Element Recording (`captureStream`)**: Records only the chosen video element (video + audio) in WebM format without capturing page UI, overlays, or unrelated background sounds.
  - Automatically pauses the source video when recording finishes; synchronizes playback state upon start.
  - **Tab & Display Recording**: Supports tab capture (`tabCapture`) and full screen / window recording via standard picker (`getDisplayMedia`).
  - Sequential streaming file write support via File System Access API (OPFS).
- **Mobile & Safari Web Extension Support**:
  - Safari Web Extension conversion for iOS / iPadOS / macOS. API availability and verified environments vary; see [docs/SAFARI-MOBILE.md](docs/SAFARI-MOBILE.md).
  - Responsive layout with `env(safe-area-inset-*)` adherence and touch-friendly 44px+ tap targets.
  - Without `chrome.downloads`, direct MP4 files can also be fetched and inspected within a 256 MiB budget, then handed to a destination through **Web Share API**. A successful share means handoff, not confirmed persistence in Photos or Files.
  - One prepared file is retained per workspace until confirmed download completion or explicit discard. Retry sharing uses the retained bytes, including after rescanning. Another source or format cannot silently replace them. Closing/reloading the workspace or stopping the browser loses in-memory data. See the [stability validation record](docs/STABILITY-2026-11-04.md).
  - Requests **Screen Wake Lock** during acquisition when available and permitted. Keep the workspace visible; this cannot guarantee continued execution during OS sleep or background suspension.
- **Privacy & Security by Design**:
  - **No external telemetry, analytics, or cloud relay**: All parsing, remuxing, and recording occur inside your local browser.
  - **Least Privilege (`activeTab`)**: Does not require broad `<all_urls>` host permissions. External HLS origins are prompted on-demand with user consent.
  - Sanitized UI prevents XSS; sensitive signed query parameters and URLs are isolated in-memory/session and never printed to DOM attributes or logs.
